## Principles Reminder

- **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- No meaningless comments or descriptions
- No unnecessary abstractions
- Keep code direct and clear
- **LLM Tool Resilience**: Tools designed for LLM use should return error messages rather than fail completely, allowing the LLM to handle and recover from errors gracefully
